These didn't work for setting color, but I kinda don't care :)
	<font color="yellow">Testing</font>
	<span style="color:#00F;">1-2-3</span>
For one thing, just like we're getting to on modern bloated browsers,
Users can change those settings (supposedly in /etc/lynx in my case).
And it's not like I really gotta have a specific color scheme.
I was thinking ANSI/ASCII art more than anything.
And the <pre> tags take care of that nicely if I ever want to go there.
But I kinda don't even want to do that...

However, one thing I really do like about the <pre> tags is positioning.
On modern browsers, it's not great for vertical lines (like at one point I
used - and + and | characters to do outlines, and it looked good in Lynx
but crappy in browsers (because of the default styles on form fields).  But
that one catch aside... it kinda looks great!  So... yeah, this approach may
be the easiest way to do a simple text-only type of web thing that works
great in both browsers and terminals.
