# Change Log

## Version 2.1

* Removed code from version 1; we don't need it anymore
* Added some notes to `server.php` explaining things a bit better
* Reorganized things a bit, dropping `ws.php` and `xterm.html` etc.


## Version 2.0

This major update added WebSockets support, bringing any command-line app you want to the web - text editors, language interpreters, even MUDs over telnet.


## Version 1.0

The original release was just an experiment; I knew taking on what I really wanted (which later went on to become version 2.0) was a huge project, so I started out with an HTTP-based approach to communicating between a web server and a terminal.  It's still on GitHub, but it's not nearly as useful - or as cool - as what came next.
