# Mobile Mainframe

It's not a mainframe emulator for mobile (sorry to the 2 or 3 of you who may have wanted that, lol); it's something else, but it's inspired by both the original way computers worked and the way we use "the cloud" today.  This project sets up a simple communication strategy for both the browser and the terminal, for sending data over HTTP(S).
