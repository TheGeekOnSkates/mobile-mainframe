# Mobile Mainframe

This fun little project is [explained in better detail here](https://thegeekonskates.github.io/mobile-mainframe/).


## TO-DO's for version 2.0:

1. As I go, keep adding features to the client:
	- Better key input processing for the URL-reading code in `onInput`
		**IDEA:** Look at GNU Readline to see how they do it
	- Maybe a disconnect shortcut/button?
	- Kinda thinking of having a nice little library around it, i.e. `var mm = MobileMainframe.create(someDiv, "auto-connect URL here");
3. Once it seems the web version is good enough to call done... which in and of itself would be *amazing*... build the terminal client (using C and libwebsockets).
5. Test, polish, WTFM, push to master, call it done-for-tnow, and start on the stuff I wanted to use this for! :-)
