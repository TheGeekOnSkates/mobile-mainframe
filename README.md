# Mobile Mainframe

It's not a mainframe emulator for mobile (sorry to the 2 or 3 of you who may have wanted that, lol); it's something else, but it's inspired by both the original way computers worked and the way we use "the cloud" today.  This project sets up a simple communication strategy for both the browser and the terminal, for sending data over HTTP(S).

## TO-DO's for version 2.0:

1. As I go thru steps 2-3, add features to the URL-reading code in `onInput`
2. Write a server program and get the browser client talking to it
3. See if I can get PHP to just relay data between the client and a Linux app (text editor, maybe a game? etc. :-D)
4. Once it seems the web version is good enough to call done... which in and of itself would be *amazing*... build the terminal client (using C and libwebsockets).  Maybe a little chat program that browser and terminal clients can get on together.
5. Test, polish, WTFM, and push to master! :-)
