# Mobile Mainframe

This fun little project is [explained in better detail here](https://thegeekonskates.github.io/mobile-mainframe/).


## TO-DO's for version 2.0:

1. I'm nearly done with the multiple-connection thing.  But it's got bugs:
	- After one client disconnects, my server goes BANANAS with "supplied resource is not a valid Socket resource".  It makes sense that it would do this about trying to read from a closed connection - but unsetting the thing doesn't seem to help (and sometimes the error is triggered by `socket_select`, which makes no sense except to my God and maybe The Inventor Of The Internet). ðŸ˜†
	- Once that's fixed, the other thing I want to make sure I do is to make sure all child processes are closed and all pipes are closed and all sockets are closed, and... yeah, when it shuts down, it needs to SHUT THE PUCK DOWN. ðŸ˜†
2. As I go, keep adding features to the client:
	- Better key input processing for the URL-reading code in `onInput`
	- Maybe a disconnect shortcut/button?
	- Make sure my changes don't break the 1.0 support :-)
3. Write that chat app - I can do this in any language now!  Maybe C/ncurses
4. Once it seems the web version is good enough to call done... which in and of itself would be *amazing*... build the terminal client (using C and libwebsockets).
5. Test, polish, WTFM, push to master, call it done-for-tnow, and start on the stuff I wanted to use this for! :-)
