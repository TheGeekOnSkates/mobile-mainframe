# "Mobile Mainframe"

## Next steps

* Finish the docs (mostly CSS work at this point)
	- Then create a `gh-pages` branch with my docs
* Add a license; both xterm.js and libwebsockets are MIT licensed, so maybe look at that one and see what I need to do to choose that
	- Add the license to the docs if necessary
* Update this README so it points to my docs page :-)
