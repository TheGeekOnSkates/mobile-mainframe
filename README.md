## Next steps

I now have fully functional clients for both the terminal and the browser.
As this project was only ever really for fun, tinkering to get my mind off work etc. I kinda didn't have too many plans beyond this...

* Gotta style up the browser version - maybe find a good pic of a dumb terminal and have it output on top of that. :D
* Of course, if I get it working with xterm.js, that opens up more options in terms of color, but then we get into ANSI graphics and all that jazz... just don't think I'm ready for that yet.
* I kinda want to flesh out the server-side of this a bit more.  Like most of what I have here should really be in like a setup.php, so app-specific functionality can go in the page actually being requested.
