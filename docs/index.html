			Many centuries ago, at the very Dawn of Time, when the Deep
			Magic was first being etched upon the Stone Table, computers
			were... well in a lot of ways they were very similar to how we
			do things today.  People had devices called terminals, that
			didn't do a whole lot by themselves.  They looked like
			computers, but they were more like magic doors; all they did
			was to send and receive messages from these massive computers
			called mainframes.  Some of them could do some cool things on
			their own, fancy tricks like colors and cursor positioning, but
			the mainframe controlled just about everything.  Everyone hooked
			up their machines to them, anything users typed was sent to
			them, and anything that was printed (on a screen or on paper -
			yes, the earliest models used paper) came from them.

		<div style="display: flex">
			<img src="now.png" alt="" style="height:300px;width:auto;"/>
			<p>
			Today, we've replaced terminals with phones and tablets, and
			today's version of the mainframe is what Big Tech has branded
			"the cloud".  Our devices are capable of a lot better graphics,
			and our connection to this mysterious thing we call the cloud
			is wireless now.  Yes, technology has come a long way since the
			Dawn of Time, and at one point were were really using all that
			power to its full potential... but nowadays we've kind of gone
			back to where our devices are just how we get in.  All the good
			stuff is done "in the clouds".
			</p>
		</div>
		<p>
		Now I'm over-simplifying a lot - and any computer geek would agree
		that the analogy is a stretch - but it's kinda not (lol).  Our
		computers are so powerful that we can run emulators in emulators.
		I can run an emulated C64 inside an emulated DOS box.  I can run a
		full-on Windows computer in a web browser.  We have all this power,
		and yet we want to store all our stuff on someone else's computer.
		As a result, our computers - as powerful as they are - run slow.
		Again, I'm oversimplifying here, but still... this shouldn't be the
		case.  Computers today aren't really doing that much more than what
		computers were doing 20 years ago.  Searching the web, catching up
		on news and stuff, listening to music, even instant messaging... all
		of that was easily doable 20 years ago.  Videos are the only serious
		resource-munchers that have any right to be.  But for test?  It's
		kind of gotten out of control.
		</p>
		<p>
		So I got to thinking, how can we lighten the load a bit?  How can we
		still have some cool text effects and all that, but get rid of all
		the unnecessary junk?  If we're going to use the old mainframe-style
		store-everything-on-a-remote-computer thing... how can we use that
		thing to the max?  That's what this project is about.
		</p>
		<h1 id="isnt">What this is NOT</h1>
		<p>
		Despite its name, "Mobile Mainframe" is NOT a mainframe emulator.  I
		don't know why you'd want one of those, much less on a mobile phone,
		cuz even for us retro-leving tech geeks there's just not a lot you
		could really do with that.  Also, most mainframe systems from back
		then were proprietary, so even if I really wanted it to be one, I
		couldn't do that legally - and I'm not cool with that.
		</p>
		<h1 id="is">What this IS</h1>
		<p>
		<strong>Short version: A new, lighter way to send and receive text
		over the web.</strong>  This software includes two clients: one for
		an actual terminal program (like xterm or cmd.exe) and the other for
		a web browser.  It defines a simple communication protocol (for lack
		of a better term) between clients and servers.  It also includes an
		example server, written in PHP.  At the moment, it does this using
		HTTP(S); eventually, I'd like it to support WebSockets, but for now
		it uses the same request/response setup as its bloated counterparts.
		I'll get into all the details of it in the following manual.
