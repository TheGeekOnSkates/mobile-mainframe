			Many centuries ago, at the very Dawn of Time, when the Deep
			Magic was first being etched upon the Stone Table, computers
			were... well in a lot of ways they were very similar to how we
			do things today.  People had devices called terminals, that
			didn't do a whole lot by themselves.  They looked like
			computers, but they were more like magic doors; all they did
			was to send and receive messages from these massive computers
			called mainframes.  Some of them could do some cool things on
			their own, fancy tricks like colors and cursor positioning, but
			the mainframe controlled just about everything.  Everyone hooked
			up their machines to them, anything users typed was sent to
			them, and anything that was printed (on a screen or on paper -
			yes, the earliest models used paper) came from them.  
			</p>

		</div>
		<div style="display: flex">
			<img src="now.png" alt="" style="width:auto;height:200px;"/>
			<p>
			Today, we've replaced terminals with phones and tablets, and
			today's version of the mainframe is what Big Tech has branded
			"the cloud".  Our devices are capable of a lot better graphics,
			and our connection to this mysterious thing we call the cloud
			is wireless now.  Yes, technology has come a long way since the
			Dawn of Time, and at one point were were really using all that
			power to its full potential... but nowadays we've kind of gone
			back to where our devices are just how we get in.  All the good
			stuff is done "in the clouds".
			</p>
		</div>
		<p>
		Now I'm over-simplifying a lot - and any computer geek would agree
		that the analogy is a stretch - but it's kinda not (lol).  Our
		computers are so powerful that we can run emulators in emulators.
		I can run an emulated C64 inside an emulated DOS box.  I can run a
		full-on Windows computer in a web browser.  We have all this power,
		and yet we want to store all our stuff on someone else's computer.
		As a result, our computers - as powerful as they are - run slow.
		Again, I'm oversimplifying here, but still... this shouldn't be the
		case.  Computers today aren't really doing that much more than what
		computers were doing 20 years ago.  Searching the web, catching up
		on news and stuff, listening to music, even instant messaging... all
		of that was easily doable 20 years ago.  Videos are the only serious
		resource-munchers that have any right to be.  But for test?  It's
		kind of gotten out of control.
		</p>
		<p>
		So I got to thinking, how can we lighten the load a bit?  How can we
		still have some cool text effects and all that, but get rid of all
		the unnecessary junk?  If we're going to use the old mainframe-style
		store-everything-on-a-remote-computer thing... how can we use that
		thing to the max?  That's what this project is about.
		</p>
		<h1 id="isnt">What this is NOT</h1>
		<p>
		Despite its name, "Mobile Mainframe" is NOT a mainframe emulator.  I
		don't know why you'd want one of those, much less on a mobile phone,
		cuz even for us retro-leving tech geeks there's just not a lot you
		could really do with that.  Also, most mainframe systems from back
		then were proprietary, so even if I really wanted it to be one, I
		couldn't do that legally - and I'm not cool with that.
		</p>
		<h1 id="is">What this IS</h1>
		<p>
		<strong>Short version: A new, lighter way to send and receive text
		over the web.</strong>  This software includes two clients: one for
		an actual terminal program (like xterm or cmd.exe) and the other for
		a web browser.  It defines a simple communication protocol (for lack
		of a better term) between clients and servers.  It also includes an
		example server, written in PHP.  At the moment, it does this using
		HTTP(S); eventually, I'd like it to support WebSockets, but for now
		it uses the same request/response setup as its bloated counterparts.
		I'll get into all the details of it in the following manual.
		</p>
		<h1 id="server">Server</h1>
		<p>
		Before I can talk about much else, it's important to go over how the
		server works.  The big difference between Mobile Mainframe and basic
		websites is that every page is a server.  What I mean is, users can
		"connect to" any page that supports the Mobile Mainframe way of
		doing things (I hesitate to call it a "protocol" cuz it's not like
		TCP or UDP or WebSockets... it's more of a way to get clients and
		servers talking to each other).  So the client/server communication
		process works like this:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Clients ask the user for a URL.</li>
			<li>
			Users enter the URL, and the client sends the server an HTTP(S)
			request, asking the server for a token; this token gets passed
			to all future requests, and basically works like a session
			cookie.  The client gets the token and then sends another HTTP
			request, this time with the code <code>::welcome::</code>.
			This tells the server, "hey, I got your token, now show me what
			else I can do on here".
			</li>
			<li>The user sends whatever commands the server allows</li>
			<li>
			The server responds accordingly, and this back-and-forth
			continues for as long as the user wants to use this server.
			</li>
			<li>
			When the user wants to exit, s/he types "exit", and the client
			sends another code, <code>::end-session::</code>.  This tells
			the server, "the user is done, delete whatever mechanism you
			have in place to store user session ddata."
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
		And the rest is entirely up to you.  If you want to store users'
		session state in a database, or (as I did) a text file, you can do
		that.  Cookie-based sessions are not currently an option, mainly
		because one of the two clients doesn't support it.  But all the real
		"heavy lifting" is done on the server-side.  There is no dynamically
		loading UI, no placeholders for where content <em>will</em> be, none
		of the junk that geeks like me dislike about the modern web.  JS is
		necessary, but can be kept to a minimum.  Even the markup is cut out
		as HTML is replaced with plain text - there are no tags.  I could
		see this working really well, even on low-end phones in areas with
		lousy internet service.  It's as light as a modern-web-thing can
		possibly get unless you're gonna use a terminal app.  Which brings
		me to the next part: clients.
		</p>
		<h1 id="browser">Browser client</h1>
		<p>
		Because this thing's supposed to work on mobile devices, this new
		text-only way of doing things still needs to run in a web browser
		(obviously, lol).  Because of the geeky name and the ridiculously
		old-school style of this project, I made it look kinda like a piece
		of paper on one of those old teletype terminals. :-)
		</p>
		<p>
		Now the main thing to keep in mind, if you're going to use this
		browser-based client, is that <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CORS" target="_blank">CORS</a>
		is a problem.  You can only connect to pages on your domain, which
		is a bit annoying.  In another words, if I host this on example.com,
		I can't connect to servers at geekonskates.com.  Not a big deal, but
		still a thing to be aware of.
		</p>
		<h1 id="terminal">Terminal client</h1>
		<p>
		But can we go even lighter?  What if you're using Termux on Android,
		or whichever terminal app Apple hasn't banned off iOS?  For this, I
		created a simple Python script.  So if you're a real terminal fan
		(like me) you can cut out the browser altogether and just use that.
		It was built for Python 3, and it uses the <code>requests</code>
		module (which I think is standard now?  lol I forget).  But on the
		positive side, it doesn't have the CORS restriction.
		</p>
		<h1 id="v2">Plans for version 2.0</h1>
		<p>
		Version 1.0 is done, and it works, and that's neat.  But version 2
		is where I hope to see this project become what I originally had in
		mind.  When I came up with this idea of replacing HTML with text, I
		didn't just mean black-and-white, line-oriented text: I meant more
		like a full-on "smart" terminal with ANSI support and "real-time"
		communication.  <strong>TL;DR: WebSockets</strong>
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
			So first off is the terminal-based client: As it turns out,
			there's a freed/open-source library called <a href="https://libwebsockets.org/" target="_blank">libwebsockets</a>
			that looks like exactly what I'm looking for.  So the terminal
			client will have to be rewritten in C... but on the positive
			side, libwebsockets also supports cookie-based sessions, wo it
			could lead to some improvements over v1 even on the HTTP side.
			</li>
			<li>
			That's great if you're working in a terminal, but what about the
			browser?  Well for that, <a href="https://xtermjs.org/" target="_blank">xterm.js</a>
			is about as good as it gets!  Screen reader accessible, full
			support for ANSI escape codes, and it's still pretty light (just
			one CSS file and one JS file).  I've seen people run everything
			from vim (a text editor) to bastet (a Tetris clone) to full-on
			SSH shells over WebSockets using xterm.js.
			</li>
			<li>
			On the server side... I don't have any huge changes in mind, but
			I do have a couple smaller ideas.  I already mentioned session
			cookies, but it's not just that.  There's also the possibility
			of creating some more examples for how to set up a server.  I
			recently got a free Python hosting account, so I'll probably do
			a server example in Python/Bottle.  No way to do them all (Rails
			and ASP.NET and Java and a bazillion frameworks like CodeIgniter
			and Laravel and so on and so on and so on) but one or two more
			sounds dosable. :-)
